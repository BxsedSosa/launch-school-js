## JS naming format
Js is written in `camelCase`. Which means words start with a lowercase letter and every subsequent word is capitalized.
```js
let fourAndTwentyBlackBirds = 24;

function thisIsAGreatMethod() {
	// function body
}
```
## File naming formatting
File names are `snake_case` or `kebab-case` which is using either `_` or `-` to separate each word of the file.
```
hello_world.js # snake_case
hello-world.js # kebab-case
```
### Representing Constant Values
When defining a constant in JS, formatting used is `PascalCase` or `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
```
const SecondsPerMinute = 60; // PascalCase
const SECONDS_PER_MINUTE = 60; // SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
```
