# Intro to The PEDAC Process

The `PEDAC` process is a approach to solving complex problem in programming. By doing these steps we are breaking the problem down into smaller digestible chunks for ourselves to understand. 

## PEDAC

- P - Understand the Problem
- E - Examples / Test cases
- D - Data Structure
- A - Algorithm
- C - Code

## P - Understand the problem

This step requires us to break down the questions at hand. We are reading the questions and making it more understandable for ourselves to read. By doing this we are looking for the bigger picture of what our output will look like. While also figuring out the smaller problems that will be solved within the problem as well. In this step we also will ask our own questions to clarify on how maybe the data will be inputted or how will the data will be outputted depending on unclear the question may be.

## E - Examples / Test cases

This step might already be completed with the questions that are given, maybe they come with the test cases. But lets say they didn't you would have to come up with test cases yourself that could be your way to verify that your algorithm works in the end

## D - Data Structure

This step you will design how your data structure will look for your output. Trying to figure out wether you're using a string, object, number, array, ETC... This step will help in the case of how maybe your nested data may look if that is needed or not

## A - Algorithm

This step could be the hardest part depending on knowledge gaps, but a very crucial part which will make everything come together. This step creating pseudocode is where you abstract the problem into human readable code then once thats completed you move on to the coding part.

## C - Coding

This part is more the self explanatory part, where you are taking your algorithm from pseudocode into your language specific syntax of code.
