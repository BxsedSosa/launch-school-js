# P1

P:
Given an array of numbers

- Assuming > 0 length
- Random length
- Duplicate numbers
- Random numbers

Looping through each number, find how many unique numbers within the array are less than the current element. Place the occurrences in an array in the same order from left to right.

E:

```
[8, 1, 2, 2, 3] => [3, 0, 1, 1, 2]
[7, 7, 7, 7] => [0, 0, 0, 0]
[6, 5, 4, 8] => [2, 1, 0, 3]
[1] => [0]
```

D:

Data structure needed is just the given array and creating a new array which holds the occurrences of all numbers less than the current element

A:

Start:
Loop through the given array - SET count variable equal to 0 - SET seenNum variable equal to empty array

    loop through the given array
    - IF in `this` for loop the current element is NOT in `seenNum` AND the outer current element is greater than `this` current element
      - increment `count`
      - Push `this` current element to `seenNum`

C:

```javascript
let smallerNumbersThanCurrent = (arrNum) => {
  return arrNum.map((num) => {
    let seenNum = [];
    return arrNum.reduce((accum, currVal) => {
      if (!seenNum.includes(currVal) && num > currVal) {
        seenNum.push(currVal);
        accum += 1;
      }
      return accum;
    }, 0);
  });
};
```
