P:

Given a string, determine if the string is a `pangram`

Pangram: A sentence that contains every letter of the alphabet

- case insensitive
- has special characters to ignore

E:

```
p(isPangram('The quick, brown fox jumps over the lazy dog!') === true);
p(isPangram('The slow, brown fox jumps over the lazy dog!') === false);
p(isPangram("A wizard’s job is to vex chumps quickly in fog.") === true);
p(isPangram("A wizard’s task is to vex chumps quickly in fog.") === false);
p(isPangram("A wizard’s job is to vex chumps quickly in golf.") === true);
```

D:

Data structures here that are needed just need array to keep track of already seen characters

A:

SET charMap equal to empty object
SET start = 97
SET reg = /[a-z]/

FOR i = start i < start + 26 i++

- charMap[String.fromCharCode(i)] = 0

FOR each char in sentence

- char = char.toLowerCase()
- IF reg.test(char)
  - charMap[char] += 1

RETURN Object.values(charMap).includes(0)

C:

```javascript
let isPangram = (sentence) => {
  const charMap = {};
  const start = 97;
  const end = 26;
  const reg = /[a-z]/;

  for (let i = start; i < start + end; i++) {
    charMap[String.fromCharCode(i)] = 0;
  }

  for (let char of sentence) {
    char = char.toLowerCase();
    if (reg.test(char)) {
      charMap[char] += 1;
    }
  }

  return !Object.values(charMap).includes(0);
};
```
