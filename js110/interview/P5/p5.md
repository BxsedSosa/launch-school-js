P:

Given a string for each character in the string keep a count of occurrences case does NOT matter. return the character with the most occurrences.

E:

```
p(mostCommonChar('Hello World') === 'l');
p(mostCommonChar('Mississippi') === 'i');
p(mostCommonChar('Happy birthday!') === 'h');
p(mostCommonChar('aaaaaAAAA') === 'a');
```

D:

Will need to use a object to keep track of which characters have the most

A:

SET occurrences equal to empty object

LOOP the given string split then use forEach

- IF current element lowercased is not in `occurrences` then add it the key being the character and the value being the occurrences
- ELSE
  Object.keys(occurrences).forEach(key => {
  occurrences[key] += 1
  })

RETURN LOOP through occurrences and find the highest count
Object.keys(occurrences).reduce((highestCount, currVal) => {
if (occurrences[currVal] > occurrences[highestCount]) {
return currVal
}
return highestCount
},0)
