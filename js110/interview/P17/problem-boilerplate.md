Given a array of numbers, sum all the numbers in the array. Then find the closest prime number to that sum.

E:

```
const p = console.log;
p(nearestPrimeSum([1, 2, 3]) === 1);        // Nearest prime to 6 is 7
p(nearestPrimeSum([5, 2]) === 4);           // Nearest prime to 7 is 11
p(nearestPrimeSum([1, 1, 1]) === 2);        // Nearest prime to 3 is 5
p(nearestPrimeSum([2, 12, 8, 4, 6]) === 5); // Nearest prime to 32 is 37

// Nearest prime to 163 is 167
p(nearestPrimeSum([50, 39, 49, 6, 17, 2]) === 4);
