# Preventing Errors 

The best way to not have as much [Debugging](./Debugging) is by `preventing errors`. This is by thinking about the edge cases before hand while creating your code

Errors occur where assumptions are made in code, when assuming something will be safe doesn't mean it is. You have to think about all the cases.

## Guard Clause

A `guard clause` is code that makes sure that the data meets a precondition before it is used. Pretty much going through security checks making sure everything is good before the data being used is good.

### When to use Guard Clauses

You use `guard clauses` when you can't trust that the arguments you are getting data from. By setting guard clauses it makes sure that your data will be what you are expecting

## Detecting Edge Cases

By thinking about what can break your code these are edge cases. By thinking about the extreme values that can be inputed and outputted you can try and prevent these edge cases from happening.

## Planning Your Code

While you can't stop every bug from happening, you can at least try preventing them from ever happening. By making your code as safe as possible before production.
