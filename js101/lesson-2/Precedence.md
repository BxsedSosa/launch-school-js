# Precedence

`Precedence` is the order of operations for programming, in high school its called `PEMDAS` which allows you to figure out what part of a math equation comes first to get the correct output.

## Use Parentheses!

Don't rely on precedence when creating an expression, it's always better to use parentheses because it lets anyone using your code that you want these steps down explicitly.
